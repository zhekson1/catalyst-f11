**Subject:** Project Cancellation Statement – Project ID 1100225  

**Name of Project Manager:** Fallen-Icarus - Protocol Architect  
**Project Title:** P2P-DeFi Protocols: Cardano-Loans  
**Project ID:** 1100225  
**Fund:** Fund 11

**Request for Termination**  

Pursuant to the *Suspension or Termination at the Request of a Grantee* policy outlined in the Fund 11 documentation (available at https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/previous-funds/fund11-docs/suspension-and-termination-of-catalyst-grants/suspension-or-termination-at-the-request-of-a-grantee), I hereby formally request the **immediate termination** of the above-referenced grant.  

**Reason for Termination**  
As previously noted by Catalyst Fund11 Operators, the deliverables and scope of work for Project 1100225 are **substantially duplicative/overlaping** of those already successfully completed under a separate Catalyst grant, Project 1100226. 

- **Project 1100225 (this project):** https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1100225  
- **Project 1100226 (completed, overlapping):** https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1100226  

This project's outputs (overlapping with a broader set of outputs from 1100226) can be found here: https://github.com/fallen-icarus/cardano-loans

**Comparison of Expected vs Achieved Outcomes**
All deliverables (as per the approved milestones) of this project were already delivered as a subset of the deliverables for project 1100226, hence the overlap. All expected outcomes were achieved, just part of a separate project. All funds thus recieved for this project are being used to fund formal security audits of the core protocols.

Project 1100226 has been **fully delivered, closed out, and marked as complete** in the Catalyst milestones portal. Continuing work on 1100225 would result in redundant effort, unnecessary expenditure of treasury funds, and potential non-compliance with Catalyst’s rules against duplicate funding for identical outcomes.   

Thank you for your prompt processing of this request.
