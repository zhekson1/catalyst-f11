# Project Close-Out Report

## Project Details
- **Name of Project and Project URL on IdeaScale/Fund**: P2P-DeFi Protocols: Continued Development
- **Project Number**: 1100226
- **Name of Project Manager**: Fallen-Icarus
- **Date Project Started**: March 2024
- **Date Project Completed**: June 2025

## List of Challenge KPIs and How the Project Addressed Them
This project was designed to modernize and enhance a family of early-development versions of the P2P-DeFi protocols on Cardano by migrating them from PlutusTx to Aiken and developing a frontend for end users. The project addressed the following key challenges:

- **Protocol Efficiency and Cost**: The original PlutusTx contracts were less efficient, leading to higher resource utilization and transaction costs for users. The project successfully refactored the Cardano-Loans, Cardano-Options, and Cardano-Aftermarket contracts to Aiken, resulting in significant gains in efficiency and lower resource utilization, verified through extensive benchmarking.
- **Limited Feature Sets**: The V1 protocols lacked features common in mature DeFi ecosystems. This project introduced a wide array of new functionalities, such as compounding interest for loans and the ability to roll over expired options, making the protocols more competitive and versatile.
- **User Experience and Composability**: Many actions required multiple transactions, creating a cumbersome and expensive user experience. The V2 contracts improved composability by consolidating actions (e.g., writing options, updating multiple sales) into single transactions, drastically improving workflow and lowering costs.
- **Accessibility for Non-Technical Users**: Interaction with the protocols was previously limited to developers or highly technical users via a command-line interface. The project addressed this by creating a dedicated desktop client GUI, lowering the barrier to entry and making the powerful features of the P2P-DeFi suite accessible to a broader audience.

## Overview of Key Achievements
- **Implement New Features Across the Suite**: A comprehensive list of new features was successfully implemented and documented, including:
  - **For Cardano-Loans**: Minimum payments, compounding/fixed interest, and unbonded repayments.
  - **For Cardano-Options**: Consolidation of option writing, expired option rollovers, and buying multiple options in a single transaction.
  - **For Cardano-Aftermarket**: The ability to update multiple sales at once and create batch sales for multiple NFTs.
- **Develop a Functional Desktop GUI**: A desktop client was built to serve as a user-friendly frontend for the entire protocol suite. It includes a transaction builder, a UTxO viewer, and a fixed API endpoint, allowing users to interact with all protocols without using a command-line interface.
- **Produce Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials**: All new features and changes were documented thoroughly in each repository, including updated protocol specifications, benchmarks, written tutorials, and demo videos to guide both developers and end-users.

### Further Achievements
- Successfully refactored a full suite of three distinct DeFi protocols (Loans, Options, Aftermarket) to Aiken, enhancing performance and reducing costs.
- Delivered a broad set of advanced features (e.g., batching transactions, bids, script-based payments) that improve the utility and composability of the protocols.
- Created and delivered a dedicated desktop GUI, which makes the entire DeFi suite accessible to non-technical users and simplifies complex workflows.
- Published extensive documentation, benchmarks, and video tutorials to ensure users and developers can fully utilize the V2 protocols.
- Maintained a developer-centric approach by including a CLI program for those looking to integrate the protocols into their own infrastructure.

## Key Learnings
- **Aiken as a Superior Development Tool**: The migration from PlutusTx to Aiken proved highly effective, not only for improving contract efficiency but also for enabling the implementation of more complex logic and features.
- **Composability is Key to User Experience**: Consolidating multiple actions into a single transaction was a major improvement, underscoring that minimizing on-chain interactions is critical for cost-efficiency and user retention in DeFi.
- **Lowering the Barrier to Entry Drives Adoption**: While a powerful CLI is essential for developers, a user-friendly GUI is necessary for broader community adoption. The development of the desktop client was a critical step in making the protocols practical for everyday use.

## Next Steps for the Product or Service Developed
- Investigate and implement advanced features considered during the initial scope but subject to R&D, such as refinance-able debt and multi-asset loans.
- Continue to gather user feedback on the desktop GUI to guide future enhancements and usability improvements.
- Explore deeper integrations with other wallets and tools within the Cardano ecosystem to enhance the user workflow.
- Conduct further research and development for additional optimizations and features across the entire P2P-DeFi suite.

## Final Thoughts/Comments
The P2P-DeFi: Continued Development project successfully met its goals of modernizing a powerful set of DeFi tools on Cardano. By migrating to Aiken, the project has delivered more efficient, cheaper, and feature-rich protocols. The addition of the desktop GUI bridges the gap between complex DeFi primitives and the average user, setting a new standard for accessibility and usability. This suite of tools is now well-positioned for wider adoption and further innovation.
